%\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
%However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
%that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
%plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
%If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
%modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
%what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

%\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
%the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
%initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
%is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled

This document will record all the plans of the MacAR group with respect to verification and validation. It will list all the objectives of the verification and validation as well as the plan going forward and the system level tests and unit tests we are going to perform.  
%\wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the
%Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

The purpose of this document is to outline the plan to evaluate and verify the MacAR augmented reality game. The game consists of the users creating a lobby together, and entering into a virtual escape room using their camera. All the puzzles in the escape room will be cooperative and require multiple users and perspective to solve. 
%\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
%its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

The main objective of the VnV plan is to plan out how the system's correctness will be tested. It outlines the plan to ensure that the system implementation matches the project specifications that are stated in the other documents(listed in 2.3). The plan for verifying the system's non-functional requirements and usability is also in this document. These objectives are important so the stakeholders can trust the system, and enjoy their gaming experience. Additionally, external libraries used in the implementation of the application will be assumed to have already been verified by their implementation team.
% \wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
%   the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
%   something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
%   ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
%   just those that are most important.}

% \wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
% the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
% if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
% worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

% \wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
% limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
% so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
% external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
% has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

%\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
%and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
%can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
%is done, they will be written.}
  
The Project consists of various other documentation that contain contents discussed and mentioned in this document
  
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://github.com/SammyG7/Mac-AR/blob/main/docs/ProblemStatementAndGoals/ProblemStatement.pdf}{Problem Statement}
    \item \href{https://github.com/SammyG7/Mac-AR/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development Plan}
    \item \href{https://github.com/SammyG7/Mac-AR/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document}
    \item \href{https://github.com/SammyG7/Mac-AR/blob/main/docs/HazardAnalysis/HazardAnalysis.pdf}{Hazard Analysis(HA)}
    \item \href{https://github.com/SammyG7/Mac-AR/blob/main/docs/VnVPlan/VnVPlan.pdf}{Verifcation and Validation Plan (VnV Plan)}
\end{itemize}
%\citet{SRS}

%\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
%how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

The problem statement explains the initial problem this program intends to solve, as well as the overall goals and intended features of the game. This document is relevant because the original goals and intentions of the program are listed, and the rest of the documents have to be in line with this original document, or it should be updated to reflect the changes in other documents. 

The development plan will be referenced for clarity on team member roles and responsibilities when it comes to testing.

The SRS document will be used to ensure all of our functional and non-functional requirements are accounted for and have a place in the verification and validation plan. 

The HA document will be used to further verify that all the safety requirements are met, and the verification and validity of the program adheres to the concerns referenced here. 

The VnV Plan will be used to make a plan to verify and validate every design decision we make.

\section{Plan}

%\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  %come.}
This section describes the members of the verification and validation team as well as plans for SRS, Design, and Verification and Validation verification. Furthermore, this section explains how the verification plan will be implemented along with the testing tools and plans for software validation.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

%\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  %You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  %for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The following roles and responsibilities are a starting point for how testing process will be done. If there are any updates to member roles, the table will be updated to reflect this.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan} \label{SRSVerification}

%\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may include
%ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may plan for 
%something more rigorous/systematic.}

%\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}
The current plan to verify the SRS involves using the ad hoc feedback from peer reviewers (ie. Team 2 and Team 18) and our TA, and making changes based on
the feedback from their static testing (documentation walk through). The peer reviewers file GitHub Issues for any issues they see, and it is our teams responsibility to go through the issues and make changes to the SRS based on the suggestions they have made. Furthermore, our team will create issues related to feedback we receive from the TA. When an issue has been dealt with, it will subsequently be closed on GitHub Issues. Additionally, the supervisor of the project, Dr. Irene Yuan, will also be involved in the SRS verification process. The team will spend some time doing an documentation walk through with Dr. Yuan through the requirements document in order to get her feedback on it. GitHub Issues will be created to address the issues brought up by Dr. Yuan, and once these issues are dealt with they will be closed.

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

%\wss{Plans for design verification}

%\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

%\wss{Create a checklists?}
The plan for design verification involves using feedback received from peer reviewers and TA and making changes based on their feedback. This will be done through the peer reviewers creating GitHub Issues and our team creating issues based on TA feedback. Our team will then go through the issues and make changes accordingly. Additionally, the design of the system will be verified using the MG and MIS. We will compare the modules listed in these documents with the requirements from the SRS in order to make sure that all requirements are implemented in one or more modules. 

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

%\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
%verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

%\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

%\wss{Create a checklists?}
Similarly to the previous plans, the plan for verification and validation plan verification also involves using feedback from peer reviewers and TA, and making changes based on their feedback. This will be done through GitHub Issues and once issues are resolved, the subsequent GitHub Issue will be closed. Additionally, in order to make sure that the verify that the verification and validation plan relates to all requirements, the requirements in the SRS will be mapped to the tests listed in this document. This will ensure that all requirements have a test that is associated with them.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

To verify the implementation, we will run through only our automated test cases in 4.1, and 4.2 with every version of the code to verify that everything is working as intended. We only run automated to preserve resources and time. For major version updates, all the manual and automated test cases in 4.1 and 4.2 will be performed. This full test suite will cover all of our requirements and verify that our program is working as intended by documentation. 

For every major version update, the developers and Dr. Irene Yuan will perform a code walk-through and go into detail with what the documentation intentions are versus what is written in the code, and what the stakeholders want. At the same time the other static tests mentioned in test-MS1 and test-LR1 will be performed.
% \wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
%   testing plan.}

% \wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
%   verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
%   walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

Refer to \href{https://github.com/SammyG7/Mac-AR/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Section 6 of the Development Plan} for an up-to-date list of tools.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

Weekly meetings with the project supervisor, Dr. Irene Yuan, will serve to validate the software and its driving requirements (See section \ref{SRSVerification}). The meetings will serve to iteratively check that new software follows what was expected from the project.

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

%\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
%different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
%level of document structure can be removed.}

%\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
%cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}
Tests for functional requirements will be broken up into the following subsections due to tests and functionality being related: Game Room/Lobby Testing, Start Game Testing, Save/Load Game Testing, Puzzle Interaction Testing, and Messaging Testing. The tests in these subsections can each be mapped to functional requirements described in the \href{https://github.com/SammyG7/Mac-AR/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS}.
\subsubsection{Game Room/Lobby Testing}

% \wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
%   cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
%   covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
%   table in the SRS.}

\section{Unit Test Description}
This section will be filled out once the MIS is completed. 
% \wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
%   document) has been completed.}

% \wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
% philosophy for test case selection.}  

% \wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
% For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
% can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
% approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
% and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
% and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
% needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

TBD
% \wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
%   developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
%   verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
%   have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
%   explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

TBD
% \wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
%   appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
%   technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

% \subsubsection{Module 1}
% TBD
% \wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
%   References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
%   perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
%   tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}
TBD
% \wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
%   performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
%   nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\section{Appendix}

This section contains symbolic parameters and usability survey questions.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS once more information is known about implementation specifics of the system.
Their values will be defined in this section for easy maintenance once the MIS has been created.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

This list will include all of the survey questions we are going to ask users for usability. The survey will initially be provided to at least 20 potential users who have tried Revision 0 of the game. The goal of this survey is not to test specific requirements, but rather to validate the overall system from a user experience standpoint. This will allow us to test whether the right system is being built for a satisfying user experience, or whether new/modified requirements are needed. The game user experience satisfaction scale (GUESS-18) was used as a source for questions ~\citep{GUESS-18}. The user's will input their score from 1-5(1=bad, 5=good) for each of the follow statements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item I find the controls of the game to be straightforward
    \item I find the game's interface to be easy to navigate
    \item I feel detached from the outside world while playing the game.
    \item I do not care to check events that are happening in the real world during the game.
    \item I think the game is fun
    \item I find the game supports social interaction between players
    \item I enjoy playing this game with other users
    \item I feel the game allows me to be imaginative
    \item I feel creative while playing the game
    \item I feel like the puzzles are challenging
    \item I feel like the puzzle interactions are fun
    \item I feel the game's audio enhances my gaming experience
    \item I want to do as well as possible during the game
    \item I enjoy the game's graphics
    \item I think the game is visually appealing
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

% \wss{This section is not required for CAS 741}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.


  \begin{itemize}
      \item Sam - Static testing and code walkthroughs are an important part of validating that what was created is correct. Since we have stakeholders invested in the project, being able to look through the code himself, along with walk relevant stakeholders through important sections, will ensure that the project is on the correct track. As a result of this, interpersonal and investigative skills will need to be developed throughout the projct. 
      \item Kieran - nUnit is the primary method of testing C\# programs, along with many other popular languages. Kieran will learn how to properly leverage this software to create efficient, meaningful tests. 
      \item Ethan - Manual testing skills will definitely be a knowledge/skill that is acquired to successfully complete the verification and validation of the project. Because we are making a game, most of the functional tests are dynamic and manual as any user interaction with the application needs to be tested. As a result of this, skills regarding manual testing will need to be developed throughout the project in order to be able to successfully test all aspects of the software.
      \item Matthew - Automation testing skills are essential, and are needed to complete our verification. Matthew will learn how to automate as many of the test cases as possible using industry standard methods. As a result of this, the automated test cases can be implemented, and potentially more manual tests can become automated. 

  \end{itemize}

  
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

  \begin{itemize}
      \item Static Testing/ Code Walkthroughs:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Frequent walking through code with supervisor - Sam: Frequent walkthroughs will allow for practicing how to explain the code to another individual. Doing it with the supervisor, who is already aware of what the code should be doing, will make it easier to repeat the proccess with secondary stakeholders.
          \item Reading through different snippets of code to determine functionality - Kieran: Being able to identify intent and functionality is an important part of efficient static analysis. Reading through existing code snippets and talking to the person who created them is an easy way to practice this skill.
      \end{itemize}
      \item nUnit Development:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Online tutorials - Ethan: nUnit is a popular tool and there are lots of videos walking through how to use the tool. Incorporating other peoples ideas into our own will improve our tests. 
          \item Official documentation - Matthew: In a similar vein, Microsoft has exensive documentation online, which will help us determine the best way to use the provided functions.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Manual Testing:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Developing Checklists - Sam: Doing multiple manual runthroughs and keeping a checklist of things to manually test is a good way to keep track of what works and what doesn't in terms of testing. By the end of the project, we should have an in depth checklist that any tester could follow to verify functionality. 
          \item Trying different devices - Matthew: Getting a feel for how to manually test on different devices will allow us to account for testing in any setting. 
      \end{itemize}
      \item Automated Testing:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Online tutorials - Kieran: There are lots of videos online for the best ways to automate the testing of C\# scripts, which will be a good place to start. 
          \item Comparing with the rest of the team - Ethan: Some users might identify good patterns to follow when constructing automated tests. Ensuring that someone collects and distributes this knowledge will improve this skill for the whole team.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
