\section{Team Meeting Plan}

Our Plan is to have a meeting every capstone lecture that is not software eng, or is not running. When we are behind on a deliverable, we will schedule a meeting during our time between classes to meet and go over what we will need to accomplish before the due date.

\section{Team Communication Plan}
For most issues, we will communicate over Discord with each other. Matthew is in charge of communicating with the profs/supervisor. In addition, we will also have a meeting with Irene Yuan every week during Irene Yuan's Office hours.

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item For Git, we will have a master branch that will always have a working codebase, and upto date documentation. We will have a second branch called develop, this is the development branch, and all our new changes get merged into this branch. It is meant to be unstable and most of our issues will pop up in this branch. Every time develop has a stable build, we will push the code into master. We will have branches off of develop that we are going to use as our feature branches, every new line of code gets written in these branches, and when the feature is done it will get merged into develop. This double buffer system ensures we always have working code easily accessible in master. Sam will be responsible for merging develop into master. 
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classificaiton, etc.?
\end{itemize}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Technology}

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Libraries you will likely be using?
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}
